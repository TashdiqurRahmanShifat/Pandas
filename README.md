## 🎯 Overview

This project serves as a practical tutorial for learning pandas data analysis using real-world IPL cricket data. It covers fundamental to advanced pandas operations including data loading, exploration, filtering, grouping, and visualization.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses two main datasets:

- **`matches - matches.csv`**: Contains IPL match-level information including:
  - Teams, dates, venues, winners
  - Toss decisions, match results
  - Umpire details, player of the match

- **`deliveries.csv`**: Contains ball-by-ball delivery information including:
  - Batsman, bowler, runs scored
  - Over and ball details
  - Extras and dismissal information

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install required dependencies
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Panda_JupyterNB.ipynb
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

## 🏏 Analysis Examples

### Match Analysis
- **Team Performance**: Which teams have won the most matches?
- **Venue Analysis**: How many matches were played in each city?
- **Seasonal Trends**: Winner analysis by season

### Player Performance
- **Top Run Scorers**: Batsmen with highest total runs
- **Boundary Analysis**: Players who hit the most 4s and 6s
- **Strike Rate Analysis**: Most destructive batsmen in death overs (16-20)

### Advanced Analytics
- **Opponent Analysis**: Performance of specific players against different teams
- **Death Over Specialists**: Batsmen with highest strike rates in crucial overs
- **Conditional Analysis**: Multi-criteria filtering for complex insights

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

After working through this project, you will understand:

### Basic Operations
- ✅ Reading CSV files with pandas
- ✅ Data exploration with `head()`, `tail()`, `info()`, `describe()`
- ✅ Understanding DataFrames vs Series

### Data Selection
- ✅ Single and multiple column selection
- ✅ Row selection with `iloc[]`
- ✅ Combined row-column selection

### Data Filtering
- ✅ Boolean masking techniques
- ✅ Multiple condition filtering
- ✅ Using `isin()` for membership testing

### Aggregation & Grouping
- ✅ `groupby()` operations
- ✅ Aggregation functions (`sum()`, `count()`, `size()`)
- ✅ Working with grouped objects

### Data Cleaning
- ✅ Handling duplicates with `drop_duplicates()`
- ✅ Sorting data with `sort_values()`
- ✅ Data type conversions

### Visualization
- ✅ Basic plotting with pandas
- ✅ Different chart types (bar, pie, histogram)
- ✅ Customizing plots

## 🔧 Advanced Techniques Covered

### Series Operations
```python
# Index and value manipulation
series.index, series.values
# Arithmetic operations between Series
team1_counts + team2_counts
```

### Complex Filtering
```python
# Multi-condition filtering
data[(condition1) & (condition2)]
# Function-based filtering
def custom_filter(dataframe, condition):
    return dataframe[dataframe['column'] == condition]
```

### Performance Analysis
```python
# Strike rate calculation
strike_rate = (runs/balls) * 100
# Death over analysis
death_overs = data[data['over'] > 15]
```
