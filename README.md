# 🐼 Pandas Data Analysis Project

A comprehensive guide to data analysis using pandas with IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket dataset. This project demonstrates various pandas operations and techniques for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization.


## 🎯 Overview

This project serves as a practical tutorial for learning pandas data analysis using real-world IPL cricket data. It covers fundamental to advanced pandas operations including data loading, exploration, filtering, grouping, and visualization.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses two main datasets:

- **`matches - matches.csv`**: Contains IPL match-level information including:
  - Teams, dates, venues, winners
  - Toss decisions, match results
  - Umpire details, player of the match

- **`deliveries.csv`**: Contains ball-by-ball delivery information including:
  - Batsman, bowler, runs scored
  - Over and ball details
  - Extras and dismissal information
